======================
A workflow for Alfred 2.0 which lets you quickly lookup movies and actors on IMDb and OMDb.

The workflow [this workflow](http://cl.ly/2G2g0D2C1942) written by Robert Hovath. However, I wanted to be able to search for actors so I decided to create a workflow which focuses on the IMDbs undocumented API. I ended up retrieving information for a specific movie from OMDb. This allows for viewing information for a movie or TV series directly in Alfred.

The workflow uses one single command.

- **m [query]** Looks up a movie, TV series or actor matching the query. If a movie or TV series is selected, detailed information will be loaded from OMDb and shown. The detailed information includes the option for watching plot summary and a poster in quick look, view a list of actors in Alfred and view a trailer on YouTube. If an actor is selected, the corresponding IMDb website will be opened.
